# Mean Kinetic Energy and its projected changes dominate over Eddy Kinetic Energy in the Arctic Ocean

Jupyter notebooks documenting the post-processing and data analysis required to reproduce the figures shown in Rieck, J. K., J. Mart√≠nez Moreno, C. Lique, C. O. Dufour, and C. Talandier, 2025, Mean Kinetic Energy and its projected changes dominate over Eddy Kinetic Energy in the Arctic Ocean.

Results are based on NEMO simulations CREG12.L75-REF08 and CREG12.L75-FUT08, documented in [Talandier and Lique (2021)](https://zenodo.org/records/5789520) and [Talandier and Lique (2025](https://zenodo.org/records/15657723), respectively.
